# This is a proposal to improve `@angular/forms`

For an overview of this proposal, and to provide most feedback, head over to the associated angular issue: https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/31963.

You can demo this proposal on stackblitz: https://stackblitz.com/github/thefliik/reactive-forms-2-proposal.

The focus of this repo is on the API design, **_not_** this specific implementation. For example, this implementation has a dependency on lodash, a version included in Angular/forms would not want this dependency.

If you like this proposal, and wish to update it, feel free to make PRs against this repo. Most discussion of the merits of this proposal would be better left in the associated angular issue.
